# GPT 3.5 Experiment

A starter template for building React apps with Vite. Includes Vitest for unit testing and
a hefty .gitignore file.

## Does the code work? If not, what's broken.

Yes, the code worked. 

## How is the code better than what the team currently has?

The working of the timer is cleaner and it made more components than we did, which helps in isolating problems.

## How is the code worse?

It currently has no styling. 

## How many tries did it take to get the code? Main struggles?

It took about 5 tries. The main struggles were when I tried to add additional features to the initial bare-bones app it created - it couldn't get it to be compatible across the board.

## Overall impression of the experience

It can be frustrating, but still a huge reduction in time spent.
